Over the last 15 years, I've helped almost a thousand students of all ages to learn and grow. 

I teach through dynamic lectures and Socratic dialogue. My classes are interdisciplinary, incorporating science, philosophy, literature, and theology by applying historical sources to contemporary problems. 

Folks tend to enjoy my classroom culture, which is suffused with humor and focused on real conversations about good books. They succeed academically and grow intellectually by reflecting on great books, film, art, and their own lives.
