My primary research centers on naturalism and its rivals. I am developing a novel form of ethical naturalism that builds on Philippa Foot and Michael Thompson's concept of natural norms. My [dissertation](/phd), titled "Becoming What We Are", defends Philippa Foot's ethical naturalism and criticizes that of John McDowell, whose conception of 'nature' I argue is contradictory. Virtue and especially practical wisdom are *natural*  for human beings (in a sense that I explain in detail). My future work puts Foot's "secular natural law theory" into conversation with religious theorists such as Mark Murphy, John Finnis, and Tristram Englehardt.

**"Causal Closure Agnosticism." (Revised and resubmitted)**

> Recent debates about physicalism display an increasing attention to the causal closure premise (CC).  Advocates of the causal closure of the physical appear confident that the case for CC is pretty well closed. We here dispute this confidence. It is argued that the extant deductive arguments on behalf of CC beg the key question, while inductive and abductive arguments that do not presume CC are compatible with causal openness. I conclude that causal closure skeptics and agnostics are rationally justified in refraining from endorsing causal closure and offer an alternate explanation for the confidence of CC advocates.
